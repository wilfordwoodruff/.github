## OUR MISSION
Our mission, by 2027, is to digitally preserve and publish Wilford Woodruff’s eyewitness account of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ from 1833 to 1898.
Our purpose in making Wilford Woodruff’s faithful records universally accessible is to inspire all people, especially the rising generation, to study and increase their faith in Jesus Christ, understand and honor sacred temple covenants, and thereby receive the blessings of exaltation with their families.
<br><br>
We designed this Github organization to help you personally connect with his writings and share what you find with others. We display stories and applications that people have made to help you see his life in a new way, and hopefully your time exploring and visualizing his writings will give you a greater testimony that he was called as a prophet of God.
