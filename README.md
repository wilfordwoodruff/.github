# Exploring Wilford Woodruff's Papers

[Brigham Young University - Idaho's Data Science Program](https://byuidatascience.github.io/) and [The Research and Business Development Center](https://www.rbdcenter.org/) in partnership with [The Wilford Woodruff Papers](https://wilfordwoodruffpapers.org/) project are on a journey to incorporate the tools of data science into the editorial process of bringing the writings of Wilford Woodruff out of obscurity. We leverage our [Data Science Society](https://byuidsconsulting.github.io/aboutus/services/society/), [Senior Projects](https://byuidsconsulting.github.io/aboutus/services/senior-projects/), and [Data Science Consulting Class](https://byuidsconsulting.github.io/aboutus/services/consulting-class/) to meet this goal.
